# 2014_MajorCollegeSalary_Analysis

## Project Proposal
For this analysis, I am using the language R to produce a analysis on an old dataset about College Majors and their salary (2014). This is an Rmd file and also a knitted pdf provided within the repository. 

LINK to Original Post: "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/"
LINK to the CSV dataset: "https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2018/2018-10-16"

In this article, the author analyzes the relationship between college majors and earnings potential, using data from the American Community Survey (ACS) and the U.S. Department of Education's College Scorecard. The article emphasizes the importance of considering the cost of education in relation to potential earnings, as well as the long-term outlook for job growth in various fields. The article provides a link to the github repository for the data sources but does not have much code or any graphs (just some aggregation). I will be conducting some steps for data wrangling as well as producing some graphs that show helpful analysis about college majors 9 years back.
